# Pendulum

The purpose of this repo is to explore permutations and derivations in the simulation of n serial pendulums and the data generated from their motion. The base
program is copied from christian over at **https://scipython.com/blog/the-double-pendulum/** with all credit due accordingly. Additional resources used will be linked and accredited in file and at the end of this document.

# Branch : Creating 3rd Pendulum

The purpose of this branch is to build a third pendulum into the simulation using the same methodology done in the example base program.
